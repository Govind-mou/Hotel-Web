Hotel Booking Website – React.js Multi-Page Application:

This project is a fully responsive, multi-page hotel booking website built using React.js, showcasing my front-end development skills and understanding of modern web architecture. It features a clean and user-friendly design, smooth navigation, and modular components structured to mimic a real-world web application for the hospitality industry.

The website includes multiple pages such as Home, Rooms, Booking, Gallery, Contact, and About Us, each crafted with reusable React components and styled using modern CSS techniques (CSS Modules / Styled Components / Tailwind – based on what you used). The application is optimized for performance and usability, offering a mobile-first experience with responsive layouts and accessible UI elements.

Key highlights:

Routing with React Router for seamless multi-page navigation
Component-driven architecture, promoting reusability and scalability
Responsive design, tested across multiple devices and screen sizes
Form handling with validation on the booking/contact pages
Integrated image galleries and room showcases using mock hotel data

⚙Optional: Integration with mock APIs (or Firebase/backend) to simulate real-time booking (mention only if implemented)

This project demonstrates my ability to build real-world applications using React and front-end best practices, and it reflects my passion for creating functional, user-centric web solutions. I built this with the goal of improving my proficiency in component-based design, routing, and responsive UI development, while adhering to clean code principles and modular structure.

I'm actively seeking opportunities in front-end or full-stack development roles. This project is one of several that demonstrate my hands-on experience with modern JavaScript, React.js, and UI/UX design.
